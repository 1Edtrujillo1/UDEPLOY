\usage{
iterative_merge(dfs_list, key, unify_id = FALSE, keep = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfs_list}{list of datasets}

\item{key}{join IDs}

\item{unify_id}{argument that indicates if the same ID has a different name in each table}

\item{keep}{argument that indicates if you want to get .x variables or .y variables}

\item{...}{additional parameters of merge}
}
\value{
"This function returns a merged dataset of all datasets from \code{dfs_list} with \emph{different results} based on \code{keep} argument:"
\itemize{
\item If \code{keep is NULL} return the merged dataset without cleaning the duplicated variables after merging.
\item If \code{keep = "x"} return the dataset with the no duplicated variables and the duplicated old variables without the extension .x
\item If \code{keep = "y"} return the dataset with the no duplicated variables and the duplicated new variables without the extension .y
}
}
\description{
Merge a list of datasets
}
\details{
This function allows you to make any type of merge of different datasets withing a list unifying the ID variable and cleaning duplicated variables.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item If \code{unify_id = TRUE}, the {keys argument} ids of each dataset is going to be renamed as \emph{ID}, with the intention that the merge works with the variables with name \emph{ID} (only if is the same ID with different name in each)
\item If you select the \code{keep} argument and there is no duplicated variables, then it will ignore that argument.
